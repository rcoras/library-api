# Library API

This is an API I created for my library project which allows users to create a list of books that they've read.

I planned my project by creating user stories and an ERD. The ERD can be found here:

The API was built using Ruby on Rails. And allows the following routes
post '/sign-up'
post '/sign-in'
delete '/sign-out'
patch '/change-password'
post '/books'
patch '/books'
get '/books'
delete '/books'
post '/comments'
patch '/comments'
get '/comments'
delete '/comments'

Future iterations of this project would be to make updates so a user could see other users books.

The deployed link to this API is here:
